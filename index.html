    <h1>ABOUT WHATS THE FREQUENCY</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="par">
    <p>What's The Frequency are an exciting new act that blends rich melodies with a deep sense of nostalgia. The Tullamore based group is made up of long-time friends Ian, Patrick, and Brendan, who have recently come together to collaborate on their individual musical journeys. Drawing from their experiences both at home and abroad, the groups songwriting evokes a powerful sense of longing for times past while still pushing forward with optimism and hope.
    Lyrically, they craft stories around the experiences of growing up, coming of age, and navigating the complexities of adolescence. Having performed both in Ireland and abroad in Vancouver, they aim to forge a personal connection with audiences, stirring a range of emotions through their lyrics and melodies.
    Catch them at the Croilar Festival in April, where they’ll bring their unique blend of nostalgic melodies and fresh sounds.
